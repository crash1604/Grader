all the cpp files can be found in src/ folder
all the .o file can be found in obj/ folder

tester.sh is used to test all the files and is available in the test/bin directory with Makefile
Since there are 30 test cases covering vast region of errors. An expected output files are not available .(*shortage of time)
if there could be anticipated results from the file we would get the actual output in actOut directory under test sub dir
major computations are handled in src/main.cpp
file check is performed in exists.cpp in src sub dir.
