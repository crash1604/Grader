Grader is used to grade and allow the teachers to evaluate grades to based on the marks recieved throughout the year

classes used are student and courses
These two classes contain the run time data for computation
student has the details of the lists of students
courses contains the list of components of a particular course whose marks are uploaded in a file
students has the marks attained as an array and name as variable. There is also a data type that stores their final score in a double
main.cpp does most opf the data processing
data is stored in students class objects and courses data is stored in courses class object which is an array.
exists.cpp contains most of the file validation and data validation.
If there is anything wrong with the input file it will close at the first error;
all the data is considered to be non redundant.
The program cannot differentiate between 2 same entries and will consider them as 2 seperate entities
In terms of time efficiency this might nopt be the best implementation of the required program.
